let's say we're not doing the protections yet

free space stack:
root: *node
*node=null => next is at next addr. so the queue is infinite

free space pop (*root (ptr==index in file)):
. new = *root
. next = *new
. if next=null:
. . next = new+blocksize
. . *next = null
. *root = next
. rt new

free space push (*root, *new):
. *new = *root
. *root = new

every *= is a write, every =* is a read
